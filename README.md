# Karaoke

//Add more details Gabe!!! -- ok

A simple practice app allows you to select an artist > song to a list and "play". By play, it gives you the youtube link that I added manually to the `songs.txt` file. Ill add some more features that searches and retrieves the youtube link automagically.
